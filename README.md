Solution for the PROS internship task
-------------------------------------

Things needed for solving of the tasks  :
  subtask 1 - dfs + backtracking for avoiding cycles
  subtask 2,3,4 - usage of SpringBoot for setup of the API + modification of the dfs algorithm with new Integer argument 
  subtask 5 - testing

  *Note- the different inputs are commented in the constructor of PathFinder and need to be un-commented for some of the tests
